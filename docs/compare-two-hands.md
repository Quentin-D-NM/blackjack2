## Comparing Two Hands in Blackjack

1.  Sum the cards
    + First you should assume that ace is equal to one. 
    + Add all of the cards up for each player. 
        + If the hand has an Ace and the sum is less than or equal to 12 then add 10
2. If the dealers cards are equal 21 the dealer wins
3. If the dealers cards are greater than 21 and the players cards are less than 22 then the player wins
4. If both are less than 21 then compare the two, if players hand is greater then player wins, and if the dealers hand is greater then the dealer wins, lastly, if there is a tie the dealer wins.
